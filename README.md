# jersi JS

JERSI-JS is an implementation using Web technologies (Javascript, CSS and HTML) of the rules of the abstract game JERSI.

This project acts as a preparation for the Board Game Arena implementation, at least for the GUI part. Indeed the server side of any Board Game Arena involves additional technologies: PHP and SQL.

Here is an overview of the current GUI. For the exercise, the hexagonal field has been simplified as a rectangular field.
